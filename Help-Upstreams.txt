This directory contains sources for various "upstream" packages.  The point here
is to revision control the sources that are coming outside of the CLIP repo. For
example, we want to know which version of refpol we are carrying in packages/ at
all times.  So we carry refpol in upstreams/refpol, add each and every revision
we've ever pulled into packages/, and add a symlink to the version that is
currently being used.

As an example:
foo/foo-1.2.3
foo/foo-2.0.0
foo/foo-current -> foo/foo-2.0.0
