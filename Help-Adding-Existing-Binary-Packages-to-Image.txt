There are two ways to add an existing binary package to this build system.
Once one of these methods has been followed you can reference the package in
the kickstart and it will be installed during the installation process.

Method 1:
1. Add the fully qualified path to the package to the PRE_ROLLED_PACKAGES
variable in the CONFIG_BUILD file.
2. Reference the package from your kickstart.

Method 2 (this method is easier for those who have existing yum repositories
they want to use, skips steps 1 & 2 if you already have a yum repo created): 
1. Copy the package to the appropriate repo directory (eg, /mnt/repos/custom-yum-repo).
2. Run "createrepo -d <repodir>".
3. Add the repo to CONFIG_REPOS
4a. Add the package filename to the pkglist.<reponame> file in conf/.
or
4b. Run "make conf/pkglist.<reponame>"
5. Run "make bare-repos".
6. Run "make create-repos".
7. Add the packages you want to include in the ISO to the appropriate
kickstart.
8. Build your image.
