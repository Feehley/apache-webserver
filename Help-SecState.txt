In order to use SecState's remediate functionality, you will need to set the
secstate_enable_remediation SELINUX boolean.

Running `setsebool secstate_enable_remediation 1` will put your system in a 
state to use `secstate remediate.`

There are two different types of remediation content; automated scripts and
manual scripts.  In order to specify which type of remediation is run, you
will have to import the appropriate profile.

The following steps illustrate proper use of `secstate remediate`:

--Automated Content-- (run by default in the kickstart)
# setsebool secstate_enable_remediation 1
# secstate remove RHEL-6
# secstate select /usr/local/scap-security-guide/RHEL6/output/ssg-rhel6-xccdf.xml --profile common
# secstate audit
# secstate remediate -y
# secstate audit

--Manual Content-- (to be executed at run-time)
# setsebool secstate_enable_remediation 1

# If your use-case requires you to write to the AIDE database, you will
# need to enable the corresponding SELinux boolean:
# setsebool aide_enable_write_db 1

# /usr/libexec/aqueduct/SSG/tools/run_manual_remediation.sh
