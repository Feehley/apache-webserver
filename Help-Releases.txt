This document describes the steps taken to create release of the CLIP, or CLIP-based project.

Steps for release:
0. Enter the clip/ directory.
1. $ git tag -a "<Tag name usually referencing build/release/purpose>" <committish>
2. $ git push --tags
3. All releases must be built from a clean checkout.  Do a clean "$ git clone".
4. It is possible that someone committed after your tag so ensure you are at
your tag by using "$ git checkout <tagname>".
5. Top level "$ make <ISO>-iso". [1]
6. Upload the release to your standard location used for hosting releases.
7. Notify the appropriate parties, e.g. the entire team, of the release.
